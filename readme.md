The library is intended to provide the bases for an updated HistoryCal script
and a new HistoryGen script language, as well as possible others.

Create the following projects
 - **glc.lib** The main language library
 - **glcs.exe** A interactive terminal for **glich** script language.
 - **glctest.exe** Runs **glich** scripts.
 - **glcscripts** A suite of test scripts.

The documentation for the projects is being created on a
